                <h2>Milky Way</h2>
                <img src="./Images/milkyway.jpg" alt="milky-way">

                <p class="planet-info-text">The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the
                    name
                    describing the galaxy's
                    appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                    individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via
                    lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle."
                    From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within.
                    Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.
                    Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the
                    Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber
                    Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

                    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of 100,000–200,000
                    light-years. Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, also containing some visible stars,
                    may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years. The Milky Way has several
                    satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo
                    Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.

                    It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars and at least that number of
                    planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years from the
                    Galactic Center,on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of
                    gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that
                    radiate from the bulge. The galactic center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a
                    supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses. Stars and gases at a wide range of
                    distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant
                    rotational speed appears to contradict the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much (about
                    90%) of the mass of the Milky Way is invisible to telescopes, neither emitting nor absorbing
                    electromagnetic radiation. This conjectural mass has been termed "dark matter". The rotational
                    period is about 240 million years at the radius of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is moving
                    at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference.
                    The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed
                    shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.</p>

                <h2>Sun</h2>
                <img src="./Images/sun.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
                    perfect
                    ball of hot
                    plasma,heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the
                    energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most
                    important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000
                    miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts
                    for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass
                    consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of
                    heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.

                    According to its spectral class, the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such, it is
                    informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to
                    white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
                    collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the
                    center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central
                    mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought
                    that almost all stars form by this process.

                    The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4
                    million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between
                    10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When
                    hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic
                    equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer
                    layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will
                    become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth
                    uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and
                    become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion,
                    but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

                    The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was
                    thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun
                    are the basis of some solar calendars. The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian
                    calendar which is based upon the standard 16th Century interpretation that the Sun's observed
                    movement is primarily due to it actually moving.</p>

                <h2>Moon</h2>
                <img src="./Images/moon.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable
                    to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to
                    the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger
                    than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky
                    body, making it a satellite planet under geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any
                    significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of
                    Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a
                    higher surface gravity and density.

                    Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's
                    diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of
                    Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic
                    period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to
                    100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is
                    tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis
                    causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the
                    same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through
                    shifts in perspective due to libration.

                    The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed about 4.51 billion years
                    ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a
                    hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal
                    interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"),
                    which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of
                    the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three
                    billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a reflectance just slightly
                    brighter than that of worn asphalt. However, because it has a large angular diameter, the full moon
                    is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as
                    that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.

                    Both the Moon's prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural
                    references and influences for human societies throughout history. Such influences can be found in
                    language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. The first artificial object to reach the Moon was
                    the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful
                    soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United
                    States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. These and
                    later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological
                    understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history.

                <h2>Mercury</h2>
                <img src="./Images/mercury.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the
                    Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
                    Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals,
                    corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's
                    orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never
                    exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon
                    after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear
                    as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet
                    telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs
                    over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

                    Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a
                    3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis
                    exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun,
                    in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every
                    two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian
                    years.

                    Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its
                    orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion,
                    Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion.
                    Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating
                    that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain
                    heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar
                    System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day
                    across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F).
                    The planet has no known natural satellites.

                    Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in
                    2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into
                    the planet's surface on April 30, 2015. The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive
                    at Mercury in 2025.

                <h2>Venus</h2>
                <img src="./Images/venus.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As
                    the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be
                    visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
                    appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the
                    east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic
                    day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it
                    takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the
                    opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
                    Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the
                    Solar System.

                    Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their
                    similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth
                    in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more
                    than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea
                    level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even
                    though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar
                    System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
                    highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in
                    light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the
                    temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and
                    the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of
                    a planetary magnetic field.

                    As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as
                    long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime
                    inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first
                    planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.

                    Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was
                    the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961), and the first to be
                    successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venusian thick clouds render observation of its
                    surface impossible in visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival
                    of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but
                    they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long
                    been a topic of speculation, and in recent years has received active research.

                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support
                    life. 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is
                    covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes,
                    rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar
                    regions is covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates
                    that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with
                    a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective
                    mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                    Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical
                    regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse
                    gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not
                    only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other
                    factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most
                    areas and greatly impacts life.

                    Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only
                    permanent natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of
                    rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational
                    interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and
                    gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and
                    most massive of the four rocky planets.

                    According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
                    ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to
                    affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic
                    organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion
                    years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and
                    geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
                    biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
                    extinctions. More than 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion
                    humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans
                    increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.

                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <img src="./Images/mars.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                    larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
                    referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent
                    on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the
                    astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
                    atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon, and the valleys,
                    deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                    The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotation period as well as the
                    tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus
                    Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of
                    Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the
                    Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two
                    moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,
                    similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

                    Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit
                    Mars; launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July
                    1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and
                    captured the first images of another planet from deep space. The latest spacecraft to
                    successfully land on Mars are CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover, landed on 14 May 2021.
                    Zhurong rover was successfully deployed on 22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to
                    successfully deploy a rover on Mars, after the United States.

                    There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of
                    extant life. Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's Rosalind
                    Franklin rover. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low
                    atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the
                    lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of
                    water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to
                    cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft). In November 2016, NASA reported
                    finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water
                    detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.

                    Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent
                    magnitude reaches −2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun. Optical
                    ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi)
                    across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.

                <img src="./Images/jupiter.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with
                    a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
                    but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural
                    object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic
                    times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.

                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its mass and one
                    tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant
                    planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior
                    generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the
                    planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the
                    equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with
                    turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great
                    Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when it was
                    first seen by telescope.

                    Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's
                    magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter
                    has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by
                    Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the
                    planet Mercury.

                    Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in
                    December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft,
                    beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo
                    orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons
                    probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto.
                    The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.
                    Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean
                    of the moon Europa.

                    The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ♃, descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, ⟨Ƶ⟩,
                    as an abbreviation for Zeus (the Greek name for the planet).

                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
                    It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It
                    only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95
                    times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its
                    astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen
                    to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for
                    the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top
                    in the 16th century.

                    The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for the planet
                    Saturn.

                    Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
                    compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of
                    liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue
                    due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen
                    layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the
                    Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
                    Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is
                    generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on
                    Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on
                    Neptune.

                    The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice
                    particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit
                    Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its
                    rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the
                    planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a
                    substantial atmosphere.

                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky,
                    Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of
                    Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and
                    fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and
                    both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and
                    Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish
                    them from the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its
                    primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and
                    methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the
                    Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered
                    cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of
                    clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.

                    Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The
                    Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly
                    into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other
                    planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost
                    featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other
                    giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet. Observations from
                    Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in
                    2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                <img src="./Images/neptune.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
                    fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It
                    is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser
                    and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of
                    its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU
                    (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the
                    astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.

                    Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                    mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of
                    Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an
                    unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations,
                    independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a
                    telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le
                    Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                    remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance
                    from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based
                    telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager
                    2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and
                    large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed
                    observations from afar.

                    Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along
                    with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices"
                    such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed
                    of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this
                    distinction. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue
                    appearance, though an unknown component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to
                    Uranus.

                    In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has
                    active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the
                    planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More
                    recently, in 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied. In
                    addition, these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the
                    Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of
                    its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the
                    Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures
                    at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F). Neptune has a faint
                    and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by
                    Voyager 2.

                <p class="planet-info-text">
                    Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of
                    bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be
                    discovered. After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun.
                    Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several
                    objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris.
                    This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term
                    planet—excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.

                    Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the
                    largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt
                    objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the
                    Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it
                    ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This means that
                    Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune
                    prevents them from colliding. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average
                    distance (39.5 AU).

                    Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto),
                    Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because
                    the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.

                    The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first and, to
                    date, only spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and
                    observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown
                    cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be
                    ingredients for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and other gases released
                    from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.
